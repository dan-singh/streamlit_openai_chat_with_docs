High -speed internet connection is needed to use Emerald.
3.	Service 3, TVCOMPS, TV Channels through Satellite: Watch TV channels through satellite. This option is suitable for rural areas with no high-speed internet availability.

TVCOMP’s expectations from call center agents:
I.	Agent should try to first sell one of the high-speed internet connection services which are TVCOMPI and TVCOMPE. To achieve this, the agent should inquire about customer's internet connection and internet speed.
II.	If customer is unsure about internet speed, agent should inquire if customer uses streaming apps like Netflix or YouTube. This will help the agent gauge the need for a high-speed internet connection without using confusing technical jargon.
III.	If customer itself is asking for satellite service, then also agent should try to recommend TVCOMPI or TVCOMPE first.
IV.	If a customer doesn't have internet, then TVCOMPS should be recommended by agents. 
V.	If a customer doesn't have high speed internet, then TVCOMPS should be recommended by agents.
